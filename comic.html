        <p>This lil comic was made for a class. We were told to make a comic about 'Honesty'. I struggled a bit thinking of what story I wanted to tell.</p>
        <p>That is, until I received a message from a classmate at the time.</p>
        <p>They were asking me to draw their comic for them.</p>
        <p>Could you believe the absolute audacity?</p>
        <p>Safe to say I knew exactly what story to tell.</p>
